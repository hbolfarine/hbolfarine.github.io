## Potential Outcomes {.smaller}

- Last week we discussed [potential outcomes]{style="color:darkorange;"}., (e.g. $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$):
- [*"The outcome that we would have observed under different scenarios"*]{style="color:darkorchid;"}
- Potential outcomes are related to your [choices/possible]{style="color:darkorange;"} conditions:
- One for each path (Counterfactuals).
- Do not confuse them with the values that your [outcome variable]{style="color:darkorchid;"} can take.
- Definition of [Causal Effect]{style="color:darkorange;"} for individual $i$:
$$
\text{causal effect for an individual} = Y_{i}(1)- Y_{i}(0)
$$
- Better to assume for a population ([Difference in means]{style="color:darkorange;"})
$$
\text{ATE} = E\left[Y_{i}(1)- Y_{i}(0)\right] = E\left[Y_{i}(1)\right] - E\left[Y_{i}(0)\right]
$$


## Causal effect  {.smaller}

* For a sample:

$$
\text{Average} [Y_{i}(1)- Y_{i}(0)] = \text{mean of the treated} - \text{mean of the untreated} 
$$

* Under what [assumptions]{style="color:darkorange;"} is our estimate causal?

* [Key assumption]{style="color:darkorange;"}: [**Ignorability**]{style="color:darkorchid;"} means that the potential outcomes $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$ are [independent]{style="color:darkorange;"} of the treatment.

* In our example this means that the decision to pursue a college degree [should not be related to unmeasured factors]{style="color:darkorchid;"} that [could influence income]{style="color:darkorchid;"}. 

* In reality, this assumption can be [difficult to fully satisfy]{style="color:darkorange;"}. There could be [unobserved factors]{style="color:darkorange;"}, such as intrinsic ability or motivation, that [affect both the likelihood]{style="color:darkorange;"} of obtaining a college degree and future income, leading to potential confounding.

* **What can we do to make the [ignorability assumption]{style="color:darkorchid;"} hold?**

## Randomization

One way to make sure the [ignorability assumption]{style="color:darkorchid;"} holds is to do it by [design]{style="color:darkorchid;"}: 

- [**Randomize the assignment of the treatment**]{style="color:darkorange;"} $Z$

- i.e. Some units will [randomly be chosen]{style="color:darkorange;"} to be in the [treatment group]{style="color:darkorchid;"} and others to be in the [control group]{style="color:darkorchid;"}.

- What does randomization buy us?

- Control for [unforeseen factors]{style="color:darkorange;"} (confounders) 

## Confounders {.smaller}

- [**Confounder**]{style="color:darkorange;"} is a variable that affects both the [treatment]{style="color:darkorchid;"} AND the [outcome]{style="color:darkorchid;"}

![](image/confounders_class_09.png){fig-align="center"  width="500"}


## Confounders {.smaller}

Let's identify some confounders

- Estimate the effect of insurance vs no insurance on number of accidents $\rightarrow$ Compare people with insurance vs people without insurance.

- [**Confounder**]{style="color:darkorange;"}: (Driving Behavior/Risk Aversion) Risk-averse individuals are more likely to purchase insurance and may also drive more cautiously, reducing their number of accidents.

- Estimate the effect of gym membership vs no gym membership on physical health $\rightarrow$ Compare people with gym memberships vs people without gym memberships.

-  [**Confounder**]{style="color:darkorange;"}: (Motivation for Fitness) Individuals who are more motivated to improve their health are more likely to purchase a gym membership and are also more likely to engage in other healthy behaviors, such as maintaining a balanced diet, which improves their physical health.

## Randomization {.smaller}

- Due to [**randomization**]{style="color:darkorange;"}, we know that the treatment is [not affected]{style="color:darkorchid;"} by a confounder

![](image/randomization_class_09.png){fig-align="center"  width="500"}

* We have "clean effect" of the treatment on the outcome 

* This would be the causal effect of the treatment

## Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

- Often called the [“gold standard”]{style="color:darkorange;"} for establishing causality.

- [Randomly]{style="color:darkorange;"} assign the $Z$, [“treatment”]{style="color:darkorange;"}, to participants

- Now, any observed relationship between $Z$ and $Y$ must be due to $Z$, since the only reason an individual had a particular value of $X$ was the random assignment.

## Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

![](image/image_dice_random.png){fig-align="center"  width="500"}

## RCT - Steps 

1. Check for [balance]{style="color:darkorange;"}
  - (We will see what this is about)

2. [Randomize]{style="color:darkorange;"}

2. Calculate difference in sample means between [treatment]{style="color:darkorange;"} and
[control group]{style="color:darkorange;"}
 
## {.smaller}

**Example 1**: Clinical Trial for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine

[Randomly]{style="color:darkorange;"} assign study participants to get either the vaccine:

- an treatment group of 14,134 people

- control group, the same size 

- Results: 11 vaccine recipients got COVID; 235 of placebo recipients got COVID

```{r}
data.rct = read.csv("script_class_09/data_rct.csv")
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| output: true
library(mosaic)

# Control and treatment group 

# Difference in proportions
prop.test(outcome ~ treatment, data = data.rct, success = 1)
```

## Issues with RCT {.smaller}

- [**Internal validity**]{style="color:darkorchid;"} is the ability of an experiment to establish cause-and-effect of the treatment within the sample studied.
- Examples of threats to internal validity:
- [Failure to randomize]{style="color:darkorchid;"}.
- Failure to follow the [treatment protocol/attrition]{style="color:darkorchid;"}.
- Small sample sizes

## Issues with RCT {.smaller}

- [**External validity**]{style="color:darkorange;"} is the ability of an experimental result to generalize to a larger context or population.
- Examples of threats to external validity:
- [Failure to randomize]{style="color:darkorchid;"}.
- Non representative samples.
- Non representative protocol/policy.

## Blocking {.smaller}

- Randomization works ["on average"]{style="color:darkorange;"} but we only get one opportunity at creating treatment and control groups, and there might be [imbalances]{style="color:darkorange;"} in ["nuisance"]{style="color:darkorange;"} variables that could affect the outcome.

- For example, what will happen if the treatment group for the Moderna trial happens to get younger people in it than the control group?

- We can solve this by [blocking]{style="color:darkorange;"} or [stratifying]{style="color:darkorange;"}: randomly assigning to treatment/control within groups.

## Blocking {.smaller}

- [Unbalanced]{style="color:darkorange;"} sample

![](image/block_01.png){fig-align="center"  width="700"}

## Blocking {.smaller}

- [Blocking or stratification]{style="color:darkorange;"} sample

![](image/block_02.png){fig-align="center"  width="700"}

## Blocking in vaccine trial

- In the Moderna vaccine trial, they identified two possible variables that could impact COVID outcomes:

- Age (65+ vs under 65)

- Underlying health condition

## Blocking in vaccine trial

![](image/block_03.png){fig-align="center"  width="800"}

## Experiments using regression {.smaller}

- Non-blocked design: use a simple regression
$$
\widehat{Y} = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 T,
$$
- where $T$ is a [dummy variable]{style="color:darkorange;"} that is 
$$
T = 
\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{for the treatment group}, \\
    0, & \text{for the control group}
\end{cases}
$$
- $\widehat{\beta}_1$ represents the [estimated average treatment effect]{style="color:darkorange;"}. The regression needs to be logistic if Y is categorical!

## Experiments using regression {.smaller}

- [Blocked design]{style="color:darkorange;"}: use a regression that controls for the blocking variable $B$:

$$
\widehat{Y} = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 T + \widehat{\beta}_2 B,
$$

- where $B$ is the fixed effect of each strata, that are interactions between categories.

- [Important]{style="color:darkorange;"}: the regression needs to be logistic if $Y$ is categorical.

## Get Out The Vote (GOTV)

- [**Fact**]{style="color:darkorchid;"}: lots of people don’t vote.

- It’s important for people to vote, to ensure that our government reflects the will of its constituents. 

- How do we get people to vote?

## Get Out The Vote (GOTV) {.smaller}

- In 2002, researchers at Temple and Yale conducted a large phone banking experiment to see calling voters helps:

- From among about 381,062 phone numbers of voters in Iowa and Michigan they randomly contacted about 12000 voters

- The outcome Y of interest is whether each voter actually voted.

```{r}
GOTV = read.csv("script_class_09/GOTV.csv")
```

## No blocking {.smaller}

Estimating the average treatment effect with [logistic regression]{style="color:darkorange;"}:
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| output: true
glm = glm(vote02 ~ treatment,data = GOTV, family = "binomial")
summary(glm)
```

- The coefficients are in log odds.

## No blocking {.smaller}

- The [average treatment effect]{style="color:darkorange;"} will be of approximately 19%
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| output: true
(exp(0.17)-1)*100
confint(glm)
```

- Receiving a phone call [increases the likelihood]{style="color:darkorange;"}
  of voting by 19% compared to those who did not receive a call.

- Confidence interval for the treatment

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| output: true
confint(glm)
```

## Blocking

- The researchers actually used a [blocking]{style="color:darkorange;"}
  design with two variables that they thought could impact voting rates (separately from the phone calls):

- The state of the voter (Iowa (0) or Michigan (1))

- Whether the voter was in a “competitive” district (one where there was likely to be a close election)

## Blocking {.smaller}

![](image/block_04.png){fig-align="center"  width="800"}

## Blocking {.smaller}

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| output: true

GOTV = GOTV %>%
       mutate(block = interaction(state, competiv))
glm_vote = glm(vote02 ~ treatment + block, data = GOTV, family = 'binomial')
summary(glm_vote)
confint(glm_vote)
```

## Blocking {.smaller}

- The effect of the treatment [is not]{style="color:darkorange;"}
  significant under [blocking]{style="color:darkorange;"}.

- What if some callers didn’t stick to the script?

- Many people didn’t answer the phone!

- What about voters outside of the Midwest?

## The limitations of RCTs {.smaller}

- Although powerful for inferring causation, RCTs are difficult to apply.

- They can be incredibly [expensive]{style="color:darkorchid;"}.

- [Compliance]{style="color:darkorchid;"} with the treatment protocol isn’t perfect (e.g., mask-wearing, picking up the phone)

- It can be [hard to generalize]{style="color:darkorchid;"} beyond the participants involved in the study.

- They can be impractical or (e.g., effect of education on performance) or unethical to conduct (e.g., seatbelts, parachutes, even medical trials)
