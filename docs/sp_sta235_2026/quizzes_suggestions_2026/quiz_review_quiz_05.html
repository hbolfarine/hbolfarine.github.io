<p>“What can we conclude by examining the coefficient of distance?”</p>
</section>
<section id="statistical-soundness-potentially-problematic" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-soundness-potentially-problematic">Statistical Soundness: ⚠️ POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue:</strong> In a model with interactions, the “coefficient of distance” (-3.00) ONLY represents the effect of distance when day = weekday (the reference category). This is a subtle but important point.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis of answer choices:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>✓ <strong>CORRECT:</strong> “There is strong evidence that, on weekdays, customer turnout decreases by three for every one mile increase in distance from downtown.”
<ul>
<li>This is statistically accurate - it correctly specifies “on weekdays”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>✗ <strong>INCORRECT:</strong> “There is strong evidence that, on weekends, customer turnout decreases by two for each extra mile in distance from downtown.”
<ul>
<li>This is actually about the interaction effect, not the distance coefficient alone</li>
<li>The slope on weekends is -3 + 2 = -1, not -2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>⚠️ <strong>PROBLEMATIC:</strong> “There is strong evidence that customer turnout decreases as the distance from downtown increases.”
<ul>
<li>This is too general and doesn’t acknowledge that the effect differs by day</li>
<li>While technically distance does have a negative effect overall, in an interaction model you can’t interpret main effects without considering the interaction</li>
<li>This could mislead students into thinking main effects can be interpreted independently in interaction models</li>
</ul></li>
<li>✗ <strong>CLEARLY INCORRECT:</strong> “There is strong evidence that moving a food truck further away from downtown causes it to gain customers.”
<ul>
<li>This is obviously wrong given the negative coefficient</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> The question is acceptable but could be improved by being more explicit about asking for the interpretation “in the reference category” or “when day = weekday.”</p>

<section id="grammar-suggestions-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grammar-suggestions-2">Grammar Suggestions:</h3>
<p><strong>Current:</strong> “What can we conclude by examining the coefficient of distance?”</p>
<p><strong>Suggested revision:</strong> “What can we conclude by examining the coefficient for distance (-3.00)?”</p>
<p>OR better yet:</p>
<p><strong>Improved version:</strong> “In this model with an interaction term, what does the coefficient for distance (-3.00) tell us?”</p>
<p><strong>Changes made:</strong> - Added the actual coefficient value for reference - OR: Added context about the interaction to cue students that they need to think carefully about interpretation</p>

<ul>
<li>Tests understanding of interaction term interpretation</li>
<li>All distractors are plausible misinterpretations</li>
<li>The correct answer demonstrates understanding that interactions indicate differential effects</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis of answer choices:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>✗ “There is strong evidence that moving the truck further away from downtown has a negative impact on customer turnout independently of the day of the week.”
<ul>
<li>Good distractor - tests if students understand that the interaction means the effect is NOT independent</li>
</ul></li>
<li>✗ “There is strong evidence that customer turnout is higher on weekdays than on weekends.”
<ul>
<li>Good distractor - tests if students confuse interaction with main effect</li>
<li>Actually, the main effect of dayweekend is -1.00, but this isn’t directly what the interaction tells us</li>
</ul></li>
<li>✗ “There is strong evidence that customer turnout is higher on weekends than on weekdays, regardless of the distance from downtown.”
<ul>
<li>Good distractor - the word “regardless” is key here; interactions mean effects DEPEND on other variables</li>
</ul></li>
<li>✓ <strong>CORRECT:</strong> “There is strong evidence that the effect of distance on customer numbers is significantly different on weekends compared to weekdays.”
<ul>
<li>Perfect interpretation of an interaction term</li>

<p><strong>Suggested revision:</strong> “What can we conclude from the interaction term coefficient (distance:dayweekend = 2.00)?”</p>
<p><strong>Changes made:</strong> - “from” is slightly more natural than “by examining” - Added the specific coefficient for reference - Included the term name from the output</p>

<section id="statistical-soundness-excellent-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-soundness-excellent-2">Statistical Soundness: ✓ EXCELLENT</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tests visual interpretation of regression with interactions</li>
<li>Requires students to understand:
<ul>
<li>Both lines should be negative (distance coefficient is negative)</li>
<li>Weekday line should be steeper (slope = -3)</li>
<li>Weekend line should be flatter (slope = -1)</li>
<li>Lines should have different intercepts</li>
<li>Lines should cross over (interaction effect)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This is high-level synthesis</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis based on what Plot A should show:</strong> - Weekday: steeper negative slope (red line, slope = -3) - Weekend: flatter negative slope (blue line, slope = -1) - At distance = 0: weekday ≈ 21, weekend ≈ 20 - Lines cross, with weekend better at higher distances</p>

<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> “Which plot best represents the predictions from Model 1?”</p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> “Which plot correctly shows the predicted relationship from Model 1?”</p>
<p><strong>Changes made:</strong> - “best represents” or “correctly shows” is more precise than “corresponds to” - Removed “above” (the plots are clearly visible, so this is redundant)</p>
<p><strong>Alternative with more guidance:</strong> “Based on Model 1, which plot correctly shows how the predicted number of customers changes with distance for weekdays versus weekends?”</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Progressive difficulty:</strong> Questions build from interpretation to application to synthesis</li>

<section id="areas-for-improvement" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="areas-for-improvement">Areas for Improvement:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Question 3 ambiguity:</strong> The main effect interpretation in the presence of an interaction could be clearer. Consider adding “for the reference category” or “when day = weekday” to the question stem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency in wording:</strong> Some questions say “strong evidence” while others don’t. Consider standardizing language around statistical significance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explicit connection to output:</strong> Questions could reference specific coefficient values to help students connect their interpretations to the actual output.</p></li>

<section id="grammar-priority-issues" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grammar-priority-issues">Grammar Priority Issues:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Awkward phrasing with multiple blanks - consider restructuring</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> “answer can be in decimal” → “provide answer as a decimal”</li>
<li>All questions: Consider adding actual coefficient values in parentheses for reference</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="recommended-changes-summary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommended-changes-summary">Recommended Changes Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Minor rephrasing for clarity</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Clarify decimal instruction</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Add context about reference category (<strong>IMPORTANT for statistical accuracy</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Question 4:</strong> Minor wording improvement</li>
<li><strong>Question 5:</strong> Minor wording improvement</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this is a <strong>well-designed quiz</strong> that effectively tests understanding of interaction terms in linear regression. The main suggestion is to be more explicit in Question 3 about the conditional nature of the distance coefficient in an interaction model.</p>
