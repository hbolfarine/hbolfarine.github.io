## The limitations of RCTs{.smaller}

Although they are powerful for inferring causation, RCTs are hard to pull off:

- They can be incredibly [expensive]{style="color:darkorchid;"} (e.g., Phase 3 clinical trial)

- [Compliance]{style="color:darkorchid;"} with the treatment protocol isn’t perfect

- It can be [hard to generalize]{style="color:darkorchid;"} beyond the participants involved in the study, if they aren’t representative.

- They can be [impractical]{style="color:darkorchid;"} (e.g., effect of education on later earnings) or even [unethical]{style="color:darkorchid;"} (e.g., seatbelts, parachutes, even medical trials)


## Quasi-and natural experiments 

[Key idea]{style="color:darkorange;"}: Find a comparison group that is effectively “the same as” the treatment group to create a “quasi-experiment” or “natural experiment”

- [**Causal Question**]{style="color:darkorange;"}: Does serving in the military have an impact upon your long-term earnings after discharge?

- [Why won’t this work]{style="color:darkorchid;"}: Compare the wages of people who served in the US military in Afghanistan or Iraq, 10 years after discharge, to wages of the general public

## The effect of military service on earnings {.smaller}

Angrist (1990) wanted to determine what effect military service had on future earnings

- [“Treatment”]{style="color:darkorange;"} group: men selected by lottery to serve in Vietnam

- [“Control”]{style="color:darkorange;"} group: men eligible to be drafted but not selected to serve

- We effectively have ([almost]{style="color:darkorchid;"}) random assignment

- This is called a [“natural” experiment]{style="color:darkorange;"} because we have “discovered” what is nearly an RCT out “in the wild”!

- For white men, earnings in the 1980s were [15% lower]{style="color:darkorchid;"} in the treatment group; military service in Vietnam really did cause those serving to have less earning power long-term

## Quasi-and natural experiments

- These are called [**quasi-experiments**]{style="color:darkorange;"} or [natural experiments]{style="color:darkorange;"} because participants are not randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, but groups are selected in such a way that the assignment can be thought of as effectively random.

## Difference-in-differences

A [**natural experiment**]{style="color:darkorange;"} of the minimum wage

- What happens if we raise the minimum wage?

- Economic theory says there should be [fewer jobs]{style="color:darkorchid;"}.

- Why can’t we just compare the unemployment rate in places with a low minimum wage (e.g., Texas) to places with a high minimum wage (e.g., California)?

- Why [can’t we just do a randomized]{style="color:darkorchid;"} controlled trial to study the impact of raising the minimum wage?

## Difference-in-differences

- In 1992, New Jersey’s minimum wage went from [\$4.25]{style="color:darkorange;"} to [\$5.05]{style="color:darkorange;"}

- The minimum wage in Pennsylvania remained at [\$4.25]{style="color:darkorange;"}

- Researchers measured employment at 410 fast food restaurants in NJ and PA both before and after the change

- This is a [“natural” experiment]{style="color:darkorange;"} because the two groups arose naturally (rather than being assigned by the researchers)

## Pre vs post comparison


|         | Before | After | Difference |
|---------|:--------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| New Jersey | 20.44  | 21.03 | 0.59    |

- Employment went up by [0.59]{style="color:darkorange;"} employees per store in NJ. Can we interpret this as a causal effect?

- We cannot distinguish the effect of the minimum wage increase from [other things]{style="color:darkorange;"} that changed in NJ at the same time.

## NJ vs PA comparison 

|              | After | 
|--------------|:--------:|
| Pennsylvania |21.17 | 
| New Jersey |21.03 | 
| Difference |−0.14| 

- After the policy change, employment was [0.14]{style="color:darkorange;"} employees per store less in NJ than in PA. Can we interpret this as a causal effect?

- We cannot distinguish the effect of the minimum wage increase from other differences between PA and NJ.

## Difference-in-differences

|               | Before | After | Difference |
|---------------|--------|-------|------------|
| Pennsylvania  | 23.33  | 21.17 | -2.16      |
| New Jersey    | 20.44  | 21.03 | 0.59       |
| Difference    | -2.89  | -0.14 | [2.76]{style="color:darkorchid;"} |

- The [difference of the differences]{style="color:darkorange;"} (−0.14 − (−2.89) or
0.59 − (−2.16)) gives us the [**causal effect**]{style="color:darkorange;"} of the policy change.

## Difference-in-differences {.smaller}

- Why can’t we just compare college attainment of students who were and were not offered financial aid?

- In 1982, the US government [ended a program]{style="color:darkorchid;"} that provided $6,700 in financial aid to students whose parents were deceased.

- We can therefore compare college attainment among four groups to get a [natural experiment]{style="color:darkorange;"} of the impact of financial aid:

- Students with [deceased parents]{style="color:darkorchid;"}, before 1982

- Students with [deceased parents]{style="color:darkorchid;"}, after 1982

- Students [without deceased parents]{style="color:darkorange;"}, before 1982 

- Students [without deceased parents]{style="color:darkorange;"}, after 1982

## Difference-in-differences {.smaller}

What is the impact of financial aid on degree attainment?

|                        | 1979-81 | 1982-83 | Difference |
|------------------------|---------|---------|------------|
| With deceased parents  | 56%     | 35%     | 21%        |
| Without deceased parents | 50%     | 48%   | 2%         |
| Difference             | 6%      | -13%    | [19%]{style="color:darkorchid;"}        |

- The $6,700 in financial aid led to a [19-percentage]{style="color:darkorange;"} point increase in college attainment.

## Diff \& Diff in Regression {.smaller}

We can also do the [difference-in-differences calculation]{style="color:darkorange;"} using regression. If we set:
$$
T = 
\begin{cases} 
1, & \text{for stores in New Jersey (treatment)} \\
0, & \text{for stores in Pennsylvania (control)}
\end{cases}
$$

and

$$
X = 
\begin{cases} 
1, & \text{for measurements after the policy change (post)} \\
0, & \text{for measurements before the policy change (pre)}
\end{cases}
$$

Then we can fit the same regression discontinuity model with interaction. 
$$
\widehat{Y} = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1X + \widehat{\beta}_2T + \widehat{\beta}_3T\cdot X
$$
The coefficient $\widehat{\beta}_3$ of $T$ is the causal effect we’re looking for!

## Assumptions 

- [Parallel Trends]{style="color:darkorange;"}

- In the absence of the intervention, treatment and control group would
have changed in the same way

## Natural experiments

Ways to [**create natural experiments**]{style="color:darkorange;"} 

- [Geographic boundaries]{style="color:darkorange;"}  (e.g., NJ vs PA minimum wage example)

- [Policy changes]{style="color:darkorange;"}  (e.g., financial aid policy change example)

- [Lotteries]{style="color:darkorange;"}  (e.g., Vietnam draft lottery example)

- [Arbitrary cutoffs]{style="color:darkorange;"}
